Currently there are three tools in the katydid toolkit:

  * Relapse: a regular expression type language for trees that matches up to 1000000s of records per second,
  * A collection of parsers (protobuf, json, xml, reflected go structures, yaml) which are easily extendable, and
  * A collection of encoders (protobuf, json, xml, reflected go structures) which are useful for dynamic transcoding.
